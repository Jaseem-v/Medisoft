                        Medisoft screens are designed specifically to be user-friendly. With the sales module, we cover
                        a wide range of functionalities, and we convert the manual and time-consuming tasks to simple,
                        user-friendly tasks.



                        Using the sales module, the user will be able to search for the products even without using
                        product codes, eliminating the need to remember product codes. Users will be able to view
                        detailed data regarding the products, including and not limited to MRP and Expiry Date.

                        Users can auto-populate the Doctor Name and Patient Name from previous prescriptions and also
                        work on multiple prescriptions at the same time on a single machine. This allows you to work on
                        short and large prescriptions, which in turn will eliminate long waiting times for your
                        customers.

                        There are multiple built-in validations in place, such as Expiry Date & Banned Drug checks,
                        which allow you to create an error-free bill and provide a better service for your customers.



                        While generating the Sales Bill, you have the option to print/not-print. There are screens that
                        will help identify the non-printed Sales Bills and provide the option to print them individually
                        or as a batch.



                        Our main aim is to provide you with a hassle-free system that helps you to provide better
                        service to your customers. With that in mind, our application is designed in such a way that,
                        you will be able to access and navigate through different screens using a mouse-free approach. -->
